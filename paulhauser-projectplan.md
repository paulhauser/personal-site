# CS 1520 Project Plan - Paul Hauser

## Technology

I plan on using the languages / technologies that we will be covering in CS 1520. I want to use the Bootstrap front-end framework to simplify front-end design and familiarize myself with it. I will be using XAMPP since it came highly recommended from Matt.

  * Apache (XAMPP)
  * PHP
  * Bootstrap
  * JavaScript
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
## Content

I will be creating a personal website with an emphasis on getting a job. It will contain my resume and projects relevant to an employer. I'm also consedering a personal background story to explain some of the things I did in my 20's and why I'm an old person getting into programming.

## Questions?
  * Would implementing an MVC structure make the project more complex?
  * My current plan sounds pretty basic, any suggestions of interesting/cool stuff I could do? Is what I'm considering enough?
